# Future Development Recommendations
**For Indian IT Services Company Context**

## 1. Trust & Legal Pages (Crucial for Business Validation)
Indian MSME clients and Schools look for legal validity before signing contracts.
*   **Privacy Policy & Terms of Service:** Mandatory for SEO and running Google Ads.
*   **Refund Policy:** Explicitly state rules for Hosting/Software to avoid disputes.

## 2. "Portfolio" or "Case Studies" Page
We have a placeholder link (`portfolio.html`), but building this is critical.
*   **Gallery:** Screenshots of websites you've built.
*   **Filterable Grid:** [Education] [E-commerce] [Corporate].
*   **Impact Metrics:** "Increased admissions by 20% for XYZ College."

## 3. "Get a Quote" Calculator (Lead Magnet)
Instead of just a contact form, build a simple interactive cost estimator.
*   *Select Service:* Website (Static/Dynamic) -> *Pages:* 5-10 -> *Features:* Chatbot, SEO.
*   *Result:* "Estimated Cost: ₹15,000 - ₹25,000".
*   *Why:* Filters out low-budget leads and captures serious intent.

## 4. WhatsApp Chat Widget (Live)
We have a link, but a floating sticky widget is standard in India.
*   **Feature:** Stick to bottom-right corner.
*   **Behavior:** Opens WhatsApp Web/App directly with a pre-filled message ("Hi, interested in ERP Demo").

## 5. Hosting & Domain Pricing Tables
Since you offer Hosting, a dedicated pricing page is needed.
*   **Tables:** Basic (₹X/year) vs Pro (₹Y/year).
*   **Specs:** Storage, Bandwidth, SSL details.
*   **SEO Benefit:** Targets keywords like "Cheap hosting in India".

## 6. Blog / Knowledge Base
*   **Content Marketing:** Articles like "Why your School needs an ERP in 2024" or "How to get a website for your startup".
*   **SEO:** Drives organic traffic.

## 7. Career Page
*   **Hiring:** "Join Us" section for developers/sales interns.
*   **Culture:** Photos of office celebrations (Diwali/Holi) build a "Real Company" image.

### Immediate Next Step Recommendation:
I recommend building the **About Us** (`about.html`) and **Portfolio** (`portfolio.html`) pages next. These complete the navigation content and are top 3 visited pages by potential clients.
